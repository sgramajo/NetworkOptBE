I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like \"Cookie Dough\", \"That's a S'more\", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in \"Bake Shop\" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, \"Zoku Quick Pops\" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, \"Top Pops\" by Emily Zaiden is far better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excels at Sweet Dessert Pops, but Falls Short on the Fruit Pops.", "unixReviewTime": 1367712000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2013"},

There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas.

I have to say, however, that some of the instructions in it were contradicted by our instructor and she said she was instructed by Wilton to do so. I certainly felt that her way was better and, since it involves such basic instructions, I wanted to share it with you.For all the projects in this book other than covering the cake base and the cake itself--that is to say all the flowers, the bow, the leaves, and the borders along the bottom--wherever it says to use just gum paste, you should use a 1/2 gum paste and 1/2 fondant mix. Sure enough, it made it easier to do everything, there was less hardening and bumps, and everything looked prettier. (I had previously worked with gum paste on my own and wish I'd known this).Another thing that I noticed is that, in some cases, (especially the bow) the final product would have looked MUCH nicer if we'd made them thinner rather than as instructed in the booklet. It may be that, since this is an introductory course to forming decorations by sculpting rather than by piping, maybe they thought that thinner would have been harder to work with.But, all in all, it's a very nice reference (as well as an effective advertisement for countless Wilton products!)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Companion booklet for Level 3 Fondant & Gum Paste", "unixReviewTime": 1331596800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2012"},

It is just too small for normal tasks.  Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.

I have found the pulse control to be superior to the larger processors even - you can custom-chop tomatoes and walnuts (a quite difficult task) to your liking. The reason that I would recommend this specific model over other Cuisinart mini-preps is that this one is truly a miniature version of the full-sized processors - same Cuisinart quality, same original design that has worked for years. I have repeatedly washed the removable parts in the dishwasher with no problems - much easier to clean than any other processor I have used.The only mild complaint I have is that the blade does not seal as well as the larger Cuisinarts - it does make a perfect, restaraunt-quality smoothie, but I would use less than the amount suggested by the recipe book if you don't want a liquidy mess on your hands.

The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven. The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me. Also impressive is how wonderfully well they work!After reading a lot of the Amazon reviews-- not all 350+-- I was convinced this mini-chopper-processor would be a better replacement for the small, inexpensive Black and Decker that burned out with no warning after one year of very mild use. Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion. Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving. Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day. The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew. Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work. The slightly larger cup capacity, two speeds, a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart, and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips, sauces and icings for unexpected company-- as well as, the morning and evening cat food.The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter. I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere. If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.Why only 4 stars?I think it is a great little tool, but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out. And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly, when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left.(No, not together! I wash it out well between food types.)Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop. That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds. Some other reviewer mentioned the burning smell also, so I assume it is normal...Anyway, if it is still doing this before the warranty runs I will have to send the Little Honey back.

It does about 80 percent of what a large food processor does, and it's easier to clean and takes up less space.If you find you typically chop herbs, make pesto and blended sauces, herb butters and the like and do NOT use the food processor for batters, doughs and slicing, you might consider the Mini-Prep. The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp. I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato, dried tomato, oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture (chopped but not liquified.)One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl. If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect. It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white. Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process.

The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs. That was not its intended design, or function.I obtained my first mini prep as a promotional gift with a DLC-7 purchase. For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen. When their lexan lids eventually chipped, (which admittedly is a major cause of aggravation with Cuisinart's products) I opted to replace them rather than spend up to 50% of their new cost for replacement bowls. I upgraded the old DLC-7 that is still mechanically perfect, with a MP-14 TM Limited Edition.The Mini Prep perfectly compliments larger processors. I specifically elected to stay with Cuisinart's older, boxier design; because its function is favored over the newer, sleeker model, the DLC-2ABC.The mini prep makes delectable, creamy homemade sauces and dressings. It performs equally well making pesto, cr&egrave;med butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas. It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be \"pulsed\" on and off with an instantaneous response. This offers a demanding cook tremendous control over several types of prep functions conducive to small processors.Mini Prep seems perfectly designed to make one and a half cup portions of emulsified sauces and dressings, such as cilantro mayonnaise for grilled fish, or a dollop on fresh corn salad.Here is a basic example of how I use this workhorse.Herb mayonnaise:  place dry seasonings, a dab of honey, poupon mustard, flavored vinegars, or lemon/lime juice in the jar. Pulse to mix. Add about a tablespoon (who measures?) of Just Whites, dry pasteurized egg whites to the liquid (no cholesterol, calories, or salmonellae fears) ---pulse to mix---add a hand full of fresh herbs (cilantro, or dill, or tarragon is nice)----pulse to chop slightly. Then use the wonderfully designed lid that holds oil and has two holes on the top that will drizzle in the oil of your choice, without opening the lid, or fiddling with additional attachments that drizzle oil. You have the additional control to shift the motor speed instantaneously from high speed, to slower, or pulse mode, in direct accordance to your temperamental sauce's precise requirement as it thickens.Result: Restaurant quality chef's sauces come together effortlessly in minutes! Large processor's work bowls are too large for this type of job. One must repeatedly scrape the bowl's sides, and the motors are additionally too powerful to make small portions described above as successfully as the Mini Prep's performance.The Mini prep is very lightweight which makes it a delight to store in the pantry. It assembles and disassembles quickly and effortlessly. I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions.

I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.

(which was not disclosed on the technical information).  The cord was thin, and only had two prongs at the end, in comparison with my old Waring blender with a very thick black cord and  3 prongs at the end for heavy duty performance.My enthusiam dampened, I put an inch of freshly peeled and thinly sliced ginger in the blender, went first topuree, then to liquify, then with no decent results went through all of the  different selections and barely got useable results.  I then put in a half of bunch of parsely, (unchopped)  read the instruction booklet, tried the selections for different speeds, and end up with chopped parsley flakes everywhere.  Unwilling to give up in spite of failed attempts, I added my berries, and applesauce. Berries, sweet, soft berries, and soft applesauce. I pureed, I liquidfied, I went through all the speeds, and ended up with bits of berries, ginger, and tons of parsely flakes everywhere and produced the worst unblended drink in my blending career.  Perhaps most people don't blend fresh ginger and parsely (so-o good for you and tasty too), but my old waring blender has been making this drink for me for years, giving me smooth pureed results each time.Hindsight being better than foresight, I realized I allowed myself to be seduced with the very nice new shape of the blender jar, thinking it would work much better than the old shape, and the new \"touch pads\" .  Wrong on both counts.  The wide shortened new shape looks great, but somehow doesn't work as well as the narrow original shape of the blending jars.  The touch pads are a pain to use, and you have to be in the right light to see if you've turned the machine on or if it's off.

It has been a wonderful kitchen gadget, as long as we keep a few things in mind...1) We store the bowl in the freezer rather than trying to freeze it only when we want ice cream.  This ensures that it is nice andfrozen.2) We haven't tried to make frozen yogurt in it - only ice cream - so I don't know how it works with the yogurt.3) Ice cream recipes that call for something other than cream don't freeze as well and don't last as long after they are made.  When we make ice cream with just milk or with evaporated milk, we have to let the machine run longer and then we have to eat the ice cream within a couple of days.  It will also have a more crystallized and less creamy texture.  Ice cream with a combination of heavy cream and milk is phenomenal, though!  It will still form some ice crystals after several days in the freezer, but it's not bad at all.4) If we chill a metal mixing bowl in the freezer for a few minutes and then mix up the ice cream in it before putting it in the ice cream maker, it starts off colder and freezes better.So far I have not figured out how to make a nice, creamy low-fat ice cream in this maker, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.

This is the same one as the 4qt. ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger. (I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.  It was on sale at Wal-Mart and even cheaper than Amazon.I then exchanged the above ice cream maker, after issues I will get to, for the Rival Gel.You'll notice, however, I have the \"verified purchase stamp\" on my review of the Cuisinart 1.5 qt automatic ice cream maker. That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon. It's a keeper. However, you may actually prefer one of the other ones I used more if your needs are different from my own so I'll break down my experiences and you can decide:But first...some TROUBLESHOOTING that may help you regardless of the ice cream maker you choose. Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning. They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly. They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract. It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well. Use pure vanilla only.3.Your ingredients should be cold prior to adding them to the ice cream maker.4.If you have an electric ice cream maker it needs to be on and spinning prior to putting the ingredients in. If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up. (Unfortunately you can't do this on the Rival 4 and 6 qt electric so it always wound up a little runny for me.)5.If you use an electric gel-bowl ice cream maker the bowl should be stored at the back of your freezer where it is coldest. If your freezer is full of other foods, it will actually be colder than if it is empty so an empty freezer may mean you need to freeze your gel-filled ice cream bowl longer.6.Cream has a higher butterfat content than milk so it begins to melt far faster and will take longer to freeze so you will see differences from soy milk, milk, non-fat milk etc.ICE CREAM CAPACITY:Rival Electric (RE) 4 or 6 qts, depending upon which model you choose.Rival Gel (RG) one quartCuisinart Automatic (CA) 1.5 qtsNOISE LEVEL:RE: loud; cannot hold a conversation in the same room it's inRG: loud; cannot hold a convesation in the same room it's inCA: surprisingly quiet...not silent but quite a purr compared to the other two.BUILD:RE: Cheaply made which wound up being our problem. The outside core is a very flimsy plastic. Thinner than my Tupperware. Not only did this not insulate the ice well which resulted in fast melting, it also wore down after a week of the motor popping out of the locked position and it's flexibility allowed pieces of ice to get lodged in the sides and make the motor stop. This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice. This means you always need to be watching it during making. Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart. That flimsy plastic wore down after just one week from the motor popping off of the lock sockets.RG: Made better than the other model except the top leaves air in too close to ice cream which means it doesn't freeze as well and the fill hole is on an angle rather than top and is very small so ingredients spill easily.CA: I like the make, compact so no warm air is inside, sturdy, stores more easily with cord compartment, heavy-duty with no flimsiness or easily broken parts.CONCEPT:RE: Winds up costing more due to needing to buy rock salt and crushed ice each time. The manual states to use crushed ice only and this is because the top pops off easily and ice can get lodged between spinning bowl and the side. For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily. Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street. You don't want it in your yard either. Very messy with all the rock salt and ice being poured in while running in comparison to the other two models.RG: Freeze the gel bowl for about 24 hours and use no rock salt or ice.CA: Same as the RG.ISSUES:RE: Had lots of problems with having to fool with it during the process to make it work right, turns off automatically even if the icecream is runny when it senses the edges are done.RG: Motor overheats easily and when it does this it turns off automatically and won't allow you to start it again for another 20 minutes. An ice cream maker isn't needed to mix ingredients but to whip air into it so it doesn't freeze as an ice block but instead becomes fluffy. This means you ruin your mix and have to start over. They need a more powerful motor to avoid this rather than an auto shut off which ruins your batch.CA: Does not turn off automatically and has never overheated. If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.  I haven't yet had any problems with my Cuisinart but will report back if one comes up.TIME NEEDED TO WORK:RE: Usually 50 minRG:  Usually 35 to 38 minCA:  Usually 20 to 30 minThe time will vary per ingredients.  I based the above all on my plain vanilla recipe.All models come with a basic recipe book but they are so basic you'll probably want a good ice cream recipe book.  I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.  The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.  You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway. Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.  It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped. It says to get it hard you should freeze it for 4 hours but the next day, since air wasn't whipped in, it left it a block of ice and I couldn't even scoop it. Because of this and then the plastic lock in wearing out is why I returned it for the Rival Gel.RG: I got a good batch but it was still softer than I wanted, however the next 2 times the motor got hot and, as per the owners manual, apparently this design flaw is common enough that it turns itself off when this happens and won't start again for another 20 min leaving me with 2 bad batches so I returned it.CA: If you like yours soft, 20 min seems to work well for that but I usually go all the way to 30 min to get the perfect consistency of whipped air into the icecream allowing it to be soft but still easily scooped days later.  Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one. That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream. Not an icy one even days later. This one is advertised as having a \"heavy duty motor\" which may mean the difference in it not overheating.CLEANING: Owners manual of all say to clean parts in warm soapy water, not the dishwasher.CONCLUSION: Although the Rival Electric holds more ice cream which is perfect if you are making it for a big crowd, I have had no negative results with the Cuisinart since I ordered it while the other makers were returned to the store...and I rarely return anything. However, it's also possible I just got unlucky so if you want a large capacity and have easier access than I do to crushed ice, it might be worth a try.For me, the Cusinart 1.5 qt is just the right size to keep the ice cream fresh for us before it's time to make another batch. For a large family, it may not work, but we nibble on it for a week then make another batch and that works great for us and since the consistency and motor where better than the Rival Gel for me this remains my pick.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First-hand comparison of 3 ice cream maker models", "unixReviewTime": 1276473600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2010"},

Firstly, I have to admit that I've never made ice cream in it.  I much prefer sorbets.  And oh, what wonderful one's you can make!

Just pour in some juice, sugar and a couple flavorings, let it spin for 20 minutes or so, and you will have the most wonderful summer treats.  My favorite?  Fresh grapefruit juice with sugar, fresh mint, and lime juice.  People love it.  You can also use it to make somewhat more &quot;adult&quot; fare.  Use a bit of sugar and a bit of alcohol, for instance, a bit of tequila with the grapefruit juice and voila - wonderful adult party fare.Clean up is easy, storage is easy.  The only down side to this machine is that once you start making your own stuff, it's neigh on to impossible to stop.  On the other hand, since you're making it yourself and can limit what ingredients you use, the end result can be enormously healthy.

To avoid the problems other reviewers have experienced, just follow these tips (some posted by other reviewers too):1) Freeze the bowl with a bag of ice cubes in it (thanks for the tip, Cynthia Nelson). It worked for me, and now I only need to freeze it overnight (instead of 48 hours each time I wanted to use it).2) Use a blender to mix all ingredients! It's easier to pour from the blender jar into the ice-cream machine, and the sugar is properly mixed and melted into the heavy cream.3) For fruit-flavored ice cream, use frozen fruits instead of fresh fruit puree, or you can buy fresh fruits and cut them up and freeze them. Blend away as you would if you were making a smoothie. I did this and compared it to using fresh fruit puree and found that the \"smoothie\" mixture chills and thickens faster in the machine (10 - 15 mins); whilst the fresh fruit puree mixture tends to take about 30 mins or longer and yields more crystals when the mixture is frozen.4) Put a small bag of ice on top of the opening of the transparent lid - use the bag of ice cubes that you put into the bowl in the freezer. It helps with chilling the mixture faster while it is being churned. Mine did not melt nor drip into the mixture.5) Put an empty glass container in the freezer before you start making the ice-cream mixture. Use it to store the ice-cream. I use a Pyrex bowl with its lid as glass chills faster than plastic.I modified a recipe I found online, and get awesome creamy ice cream which doesn't get frozen hard like a rock even when it's been in the freezer for 2 - 3 days! You can, of course cut down on the sugar or use fat-free products or artificial sweeteners (which I haven't tried - I believe natural is better than those chemicals in artificial sweeteners. Our bodies can work off the sugar, but the chemicals stay in our system!)1.5 cups heavy whipping cream1 cup Half & Half or evaporated milk1 - 1.5 cups frozen strawberries or any other frozen fruit1 + 1/4 cup granulated white sugar2 tablespoons lemon juice (optional)Put everything in the blender and blend until the ingredients are well-mixed. Turn on the ice-cream machine and pour the mixture in. Once the mixture thickens and has a soft-serve or thicker consistency, turn off the machine.

The first batch came out a bit icy, although okay; I decided that freezing the bowl for 2-3 hours isn't enough, and, perhaps the room was too warm.  ... Next batch, I let the bowl freeze for a full 24 hours in the back of my freezer, and also, when running the machine, I covered the open &quot;hole&quot; in the cover of the machine with a piece of aluminum foil to keep the cold in.  That second batch came out very, very good; in the freezer, it ended up freezing quite hard but smooth &amp; consistent.  So, I tried to find a way to keep it softer.  For my third batch, I had the brilliant idea of first whipping the cream a bit, for a minute or two, before I used it (something not in any instructions) and that REALLY made GREAT ice cream!!!  (I used a portable Salton-type hand mixer, which whipped the cream a little bit, adding some air, but didn't really make it &quot;whipped cream&quot;.)In all other regards, it's important to read and follow all instructions.  Then, with the above suggestion to whip the heavy cream slightly before you combine everything, you'll get ice cream that is simply superb, the perfect texture that exactly matches what you'll get in stores, even though you don't add any stiffeners or carageenan etc.I have not tried other ice cream makers, but I have had such excellent results with this one, that if I were purchasing one, I would just get this and not take chances on lesser brands.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Suggestions &amp; Helpful Hints", "unixReviewTime": 1088553600, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2004"},

(More on that later.) For the machine to successfully work, the bowl must be placed in the freezer at least fifteen hours in advance, and the mix must be refrigerated for a minimum of 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours.  Unless you store the bowl in your freezer and use a non-cooked mixture, you won't be able to make ice cream on the spur of the moment.The machine is fairly noisy, much like the earlier electric churners that used salt and ice.  But operation cannot be easier.  Simply insert the paddle, pour in the mix, attach the top, and start it up.  In 20-30 minutes, depending on the butterfat content and beginning temperature of the mix, you have soft serve consistency ice cream, sorbet, frozen yogurt, or sherbet.  To improve the flavor and consistency, the frozen dessert should be ripened in another container for at least 2 hours in the freezer.The biggest drawbacks to the Cuisinart ice cream maker are its relatively small size, especially compared to the KitchenAid attachment, and the way a portion of the ice cream freezes solid to the sides of the bowl, thus creating some waste.  Of course, you can always take a sturdy non-metal utensil to it to sample it right away.  You'll have to let the bowl thaw some before hand-washing.  None of the parts are dishwasher safe, although all are a breeze to clean once the bowl loses its extreme cold.If you own a KitchenAid mixer, you might want to check out the attachment, but you really can't go wrong with the Cuisinart.

A lot of freezers are too warm. -10 to zero F is ideal. Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F. At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second, make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time. 24 hours should be enough.-Third, make sure your ingredients are cold. Even if they are cool, it should be ok, but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great. Regarding taste... I'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners, that \"real\" doesn't taste right anymore. I find pure cream based recipes can leave a bit of a film on the roof of the mouth regardless of the tool used, but cutting with 25% half-and-half or whole milk is a good ratio. Nothing beats a good custard based ice cream on a hot day, four or five ingredients: Cream, sugar, eggs, flavorings, home run.Some things I don't like about it:Gel based freezers work, but they warm up from the second you take them out of the freezer. The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well, and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect, but obviously cost more. You need know know that going in. Gel isn't magic, but it works. You can't fault it for being something it's not though.The dasher doesn't scrape the side of the bowl, it sits off just slightly. This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream, not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side. I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord... why not.No way I would pay full retail for this, but at the current price point, it's a good deal.Also consider buying a treadmill or running shoes.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works well", "unixReviewTime": 1340150400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2012"},

Everyone who has tried my mocha-toffee-hazelnut homemade ice cream from this machine has loved it, and quite a few have proclaimed it the best ice cream they have ever eaten.  And you just can't beat how quick and easy it is to make.One tip -- make sure you have a 2-quart plastic container on hand to store the ice cream; you cannot store it in the mixing bowl because it is easily damaged.  In general, right after you take the ice cream out of the mixer, it can be served right away if you have kept your ingredients very cold, but its texture will benefit from spending at least an hour in the coldest part of your freezer.Some people have complained about the noise; it's loud enough to bother a cat but not so loud you can't talk over it.

The biggest problem I have noticed is that relatively few people know how cold their freezer is (as well as their fridge).  I bought a device to show me the temps and now i keep my freezer at 0F and my fridge at 34F-35F - and I have not had any problems keeping the bowl cold enough to freeze up the cream.  So easy and fast - as well as fresh good ingredients have made possessing this machine a delight.  I highly recommend it as well as recommending all of us periodically checking the temps in both our freezers and fridges.There are 2 main reasons for failure to get the ice cream to freeze - first is your freezer is not cold enough to freeze the bowl through and through.  The 2nd reason is inappropriate ingredients that prevent the cream from freezing.  Some of these ingredients are anything with alcohol, fresh citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) and kiwi - amongst some others.  Seems to me that anything that will prevent jello from 'setting' will also prevent ice cream from freezing properly.  The ice cream when it is done will also not be hard, like the ice cream you get in stores, but of the soft variety that you get from like a Diary Queen - soft ice cream.

I can tell you that after 8 years or so of owning this type of machine I made ice cream 3 times.  It was messy, clean up was a pain and it was noisy.  After my machine was ruined by a leaky roof (divine intervention) I looked around and decided to purchase the cuisinart ice cream machine.  Since owning this maching I have made ice cream atleast once a week.  I have even made ice cream to go with dessert for a dinner for 75 people.  Something I would have never have done with my old machine.The machine is easy to use, easy to clean and in my opinion not very noisy. Some of the reviewers mentioned noise, they must have never heard the noise produced by tradtional ice cream machines that have a motor. It is about the level of a food processor or blender.  perhaps because it is running for 25 minutes it seems louder to some people.As to problems of the machine not freezing properly, I can only say I have not had any problems.  I keep the bowl in my freezer and chill the ice cream and sorbet mixtures well before pouring them into the machine to begin churning.  I highly recommend buying an extra bowl if you need to make more than 1 1/2 quarts at a time. With my \"old fashioned\" ice cream machine (salt and water), they always recommended ripening the ice cream and I continue to do so.  Once churned, I turn my newly made ice cream into a differenct container and pop it into my freezer for 30 to 60 minutes at least before eating.  I have never gotten really firm ice cream out of anything but an industrial machine and I did not expect it with this one although my nieces think it is just fine straight from the bucket.With the Cuisinart icecream maker, making ice cream is fun and very satisfying.  Best of all, I did not break the bank to get good results.  Although I love the end results on some of the pricer ice cream machines, my Dr. Pepper pockets could not come up with the Champagne cost of those $100.00 or more icecream makers. I was ready say to myself, this machine is not bad for the price and I ended up thinking this machine works well and what a great price.My only issue is more with Amazon.  I am unsure were the $90.00 original sticker price came from. At the cuisinart site you can purchase the same machine for $49.95 just like here at Amazon.

Made the first batch of chocolate ice cream yesterday and let me tell you it was fantastic!This will not go unused, my husband won't allow it. We both felt it was as good or better than store purchased ice cream without the chemicals they use to keep it nice for long periods of time in the freezer. Buy your milk and cream in large containers kids, you are going to a)save a little $  and  b) make a motherload of HEALTHIER ice cream. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container. I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously. It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made. It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch. Put it in another plastic container for a couple of hours if you prefer a harder consistency.Oh, as for the noise-come on people, it's NOT that loud!My standing fan makes more noise than this thing, and I'd rather hear IT whirring knowing the sweet treat awaits me!  Honestly, maybe these folks got a faulty unit, or are particularly sensitive to noise- I don't think it's noisy at all :)Only one small note to mention. When it's done try to get it out of the canister quickly because it freezes very quickly to a very hard consistency to the sides, and it takes a bit of scraping with a wooden spoon to get it off (but I had a heck of a taste test while I completed this arduous task)  ! HAHA.Buy it and enjoy, I think folks with kids would have a lot of fun with this machine letting kids come up with their own funky flavors.

Graham", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewText": "I got this ice cream maker primarily to make sorbets and the occasional batch of ice cream.  The item arrived well packed, accompanied by a very small instruction manual / recipe booklet combination.To get a feel for the machine, I first froze the freezer bowl for 24 hours at zero degrees or less.  My first attempt was a Quince sorbet from \"The Sweet Life\" cookbook.  I pretty much followed the recipe instructions to the letter.  I poured the chilled quince mixture into the frozen bowl with the machine running.  10 minutes passed.  20 minutes.  30 minutes.  40 minutes.  My \"sorbet\" was just a frozen drink.  Eventually, the freezer bowl defrosted and I had a lukewarm smoothie on my hands.Thinking it was my ability to follow a recipe, I decided to try one of the recipes in the instruction manual.  I tried the \"basic vanilla\".  After about 20 minutes of churning, the ice cream started to firm up.  But it never got past the soupy slush stage.  So I waited some more...another 20 minutes.  The ice cream was thicker but still a soupy mess.  After freezing the concoction for 3 hours, it was fine, but more like frozen milk than ice cream.Next, my wife stepped in and tried one of her recipes.  Chocolate ice cream.  Same results for her.  A soupy half-frozen mess.I have lost faith in this machine.  I still think the best and most reliable way to make ice cream is with one of those old style churns.  I just don't think this thing gets cold enough.  My parents have a different model (anotehr brand) and theirs freezes the ice cream within 15 minutes every time.Your mileage may vary, but I would be wary of this machine.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Takes longer than expected", "unixReviewTime": 1211414400, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2008"},

Reid", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I thought it was a stupid decision - to pay over $50 for an ice cream maker when I don't even care for ice cream that much.  I mean, ice cream is ok, but I rarely purchase it because I'm not crazy about it and even the \"all natural\" ones seem pretty fake to me (tara gum??? what the heck does that taste like?)  I'm a \"real food\" fan, and I like to know what's in it - even my desserts.  Anyway, I didn't hold out much hope when I got it and read the recipes that came with it - I mean, sugary milk is sugary milk (add chocolate, vanilla, etc to spice it up a bit, but no big deal, right?)  Before I made my first batch, I looked up ice cream recipes on the internet and was surprised at the differences in recipes.  Many of the highest rated ones had eggs as an ingredient.  Now we were getting somewhere - eggs add a lot of flavor if you do it right.  So, I made up my own recipe for my first batch of chocolate ice cream.  Oh! My! Gosh!  I have never, ever, ever, had ice cream that tasted so good.  It was the richest, creamiest ice cream.  My husband actually complained that he could only eat a small bowl because it was so rich.  By rich, I mean a deep chocolately flavor - sweet, but not too sweet.  My next recipe I tried (and made up) was Butter Pecan.  Oh! My! Gosh!  My adult son who says he had never had butter pecan ice cream (not sure if that's true - I'm thinking as a kid he may have tasted some) - took one bite and his eyes widened while he just about drooled all over himself - he said that was the best tasting ice cream he had ever had.  The most recent recipe I made was one of the ones in the little booklet that came with the machine - \"simple chocolate ice cream\" - and it is, in flavor and everything.  My husband loves it - because he can eat more of it (it's not rich at all).  But to me, it tastes more like flavored ice milk - it's just not creamy at all.All of the recipes that I have tried have frozen well - I don't get bricks of ice, and just a few minutes of sitting out before I scoop some out makes it really easy to do.So, I guess it wasn't a stupid decision after all - I will definitely get my money's worth out of it.  Here are my two modified recipes for the Chocolate and Butter Pecan if you want to try it for yourself:CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM:3/4 cup cocoa powder (baking cocoa), sifted1/2 cup granulated sugar1/3 cup packed dark brown sugarpinch of salt1 cup half and half2 cups heavy whipping cream3 eggs1/2 tablespoon pure vanilla extractAdd sugar (white and brown), cocoa powder, salt, half & half and heavy cream to a pot, heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until just bubbly.  Reduce heat.  Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.  Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.  Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.  Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.  Cool in refrigerator several hours, then follow machine instructions.___________________________BUTTER PECAN ICE CREAM2 tablespoons butter1 cup pecan halvessalt1 cup half & half3/4 cup granulated sugar2 cups heavy whipping cream3 eggs1 tablespoon pure vanilla extractAdd sugar a pinch of salt, half & half and heavy cream to a pot, heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until just bubbly.  Reduce heat.  Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.  Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.  Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.  Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter and add pecans.  Salt the pecans and stir constantly for several minutes to \"roast\" the nuts. (You can be doing this at the same time as making the cream mixture.)Keep cream mixture and nuts separate, and cool both in refrigerator several hours, then follow machine instructions (don't add the nuts until the very last few minutes of making the ice cream.)_____________________________*Note about eggs - I use backyard chicken eggs which I think have a lot to do with the flavor.  I'm also not concerned about salmonella from these.  I don't separate the eggs, and if you do it right, there's no need.  But one time I got side-tracked and the cream mixture got too hot after I added the eggs - which caused the whites to harden like a cooked egg.  I just skimmed the hard whites out with a slotted spoon, and briefly blended with a stick blender (like 2 second blasts) to break up any remaining.  Be careful you don't blend too long if you do this or you'll cream it too soon.__________________________Interestingly, I ordered the ice cream maker pictured here, but was shipped this one instead:Cuisinart ICE 21 Frozen Yogurt Ice Sorbet", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I never cared much for ice cream until I stupidly bought this machine", "unixReviewTime": 1375833600, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2013"},

You see, the chemistry of freezing foods has its own set of built-in limits. You need to add appropriate amounts of sugar and alcohol to lower the freezing point of your mixture so that you get an ice and not an ice cube*.Making your ice just before you serve it allows you a lot of freedom. Since you'll be serving it right away, you can stop the machine whenever the mixture looks right.

If make the ingredients before making dinner and have the bowl pre-frozen, you can let the ice-cream set during your dinner and end up having a nice dessert afterwards.  It's great family fun, from what I hear.The only downside though is that most ice-cream you make in this maker comes out a bit too soft and requires further freezing in the freezer (about 2 hours).

My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price.

You chill the aluminum cannister in your freezer until it's frozen, dump the ingredients, and start it up.I would like to address some of the negative comments about &quot;freezing power&quot; and the lack thereof.First, all home ice-cream freezers produce a soft ice cream when they are done... this is normal, and if you read the directions in nearly every ice cream recipe, they will suggest another 2-3 hours in the freezer for the ice cream you make to harden properly. Don't expect to be able to eat it immediately.If you don't remember having to wait this long in your youth, keep in mind that White Mountain / brine-based ice cream churns typically have you &quot;pack&quot; the cannister in the brine after churning. This is much faster way to harden ice cream than putting it in a normal electric freezer because the 0 degree brine is in direct contact with the sides of the ice cream cylinder and conducts heat away much more quickly than the 0 degree air in a freezer. So 15 or 20 extra minutes in the brine may do as much good as 2-3 hours in the freezer.Second, if you end up with &quot;cold soup&quot; rather than ice cream as some have complained, you have one of two problems: either you didn't chill the ingredients in the fridge prior to freezing as reccommended in the instructions, or your freezer is set too warm. A good rule of thumb is that if your freezer is set so that premium ice cream you buy at the store (like Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs) is easily scoopable, it's too warm for (a) long-term food storage, and (b) chilling a cannister. Buy a thermometer and make sure that your freezer is at 0 degrees or colder.My only negative comments about the unit are that the ice cream recipes in the book that comes with it are hit-and-miss. The quick / basic vanilla is quite poor- it would be best described as &quot;vanilla extract&quot; flavored ice cream, and because the milk isn't cooked, the texture and taste are more like a frozen whipped cream. The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle... we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids. The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially. Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe. I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream... a quick google should find it at food.com.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Addressing the freezing power concerns", "unixReviewTime": 1090713600, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2004"},

Finally, I ordered the right one!  This ice cream maker really does work.  The only time it will not work is if your freezer is not set to the coldest setting.  I keep the freezer bowls in the freezer at all times, that way they are ready to go.So, set your freezer to the coldest setting two days before you intend to make the ice cream.  I also found the extra freezer bowl to be indispensable.  Instead of waiting for the ice cream mixture to cool, simply use one of the freezer bowls to cool it down and then pour it into the second freezer bowl.  This drastically speeds up the process.I also use the freezer bowl for other items I want to cool down quickly.  I use it to cool down Jello when making a Raspberry Mousse.  I have been known to place the whole contraption right into the freezer.  I guess you are not supposed to, but I am still alive.So, once you have everything all frozen, set the machine up and make sure it is on a nice level surface (in or out of the freezer).  Then, mix up your ice cream recipe.  All you do is pour the liquid into the ice cream maker and with a flick of the switch the paddle starts to turn and in about 20 to 30 minutes you will have the ice cream of your dreams.When washing out the bowl, you will notice that you have to use hot water or you may find the cold water starts to freeze on the inside.  I recommend placing a piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bowl when storing it in the freezer so there is no need to rince the bowl.  I also disobey the instructions and let the ice cream freeze until solid in the ice cream freezer bowl.  I found it just works faster that way.  That way your ice cream is ready in 40 minutes!  Yes, it takes 20-30 minutes and then 10 more minutes in the freezer.  At least that is how it goes in my kitchen.  It is still well worth the wait.  If you start the ice cream before dinner, you won't even notice the time.Here is a favorite recipe for a slushy.  Yes, you can make those too and it works quite well.PINK GRAPEFRUIT SLUSHUse grapefruit juice found in the cooler section of your grocery store or use fresh squeezed and strained juice. If you enjoy sitting outside and want to keep your drinks ice cold, purchase a few \"gel mugs\" which you can keep in the freezer.4 cups pink grapefruit juice1/4 cup orange blossom honey1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract1.

One problem I had at first was that when I used mostly heavy cream, the finished product was too airy and the ice cream broke apart when I tried to scoop it. My bowl was super cold (overnight, lowest freezer setting) and it got to the \"soft serve\" stage fairly quickly. My mistake was that I left it going too long, hoping it would get firmer. It basically whipped the cream. I don't know if you've ever eaten frozen whipped cream, but it's not a treat! This only happens when bowl is close to zero degrees Farenheit, the mixture is very chilled, and the ambient temperature isn't too hot.If you're wondering what I mean by \"too long,\" it's when the ice cream starts to rise above the churning paddle.

A lot.The Cuisinart Ice 20 Ice Cream Maker enables us to have ice cream with only a half hour's notice. Is this good or bad?Good, I say! Lick the beater, the cylinder and your bowl kind of good. All this in record time and without much effort on your part except for that tiresome spoon lifting.Make Ice Cream in the Privacy of Your Own HomeIce cream is not the difficult concoction it may seem. All you need are a few simple ingredients, depending on your taste, an ice cream maker, rock salt, ice ...Uh-uh! Not with this machine! The Cuisinart Ice-20 lets you toss the rock salt out on the slippery sidewalk where it belongs and requires no melting bags of ice to stuff in the freezer in advance.More \"No's\":* No more hand-cranking* No more frozen chunks of ice jamming the rotating freezer cylinder and stopping the machine mid-cycle* No more relegating the ice cream making to the basement, the garage or outside where dripping salt water can run will-nilly out a drain hole that's never in a convenient place* No more trips to the supermarket or to the ice cream shop down the street* No more, \"Sorry, we're out of that.\" Make whatever you like!Am I Really a Good Spokesperson for This Ice Cream Maker?You betcha!We are high-end ice cream people. That does not mean we eat only Hagen Daas quality stuff (well ... we actually do), but that we could keep a small ice cream shop in business with just our family. Counting relatives, we could support a chain of such shops.We eat a lot of ice cream and we like a variety of flavors. The Ice-20 allows us to have the best of both worlds -- with a little time for preparation in between, of course.The PackageThe Cuisinart Ice-20 comes boxed with:* a cylindrical plastic churn* one freezer bowl (1-1/2 quart with liquid encased in it for purposes of freezing)* the motor housing* a clear plastic dome lid* a manual/recipe bookThere is also a reply card in the box with which to document your purchase. SEND THAT IN TOOT-SWEET! This little appliance comes with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty on defects. Not a shabby deal in the least.Each piece is wrapped carefully in plastic bags, which I suggest saving, too ... the larger ones, at least. Use these to wrap the freezer bowl while preparing it for use. More on that to come.So Now You've Unpacked It ...What to do with an ice cream maker you just unwrapped? One might like to rip right in to making ice cream, but that can't happen with this particular machine. It does not offer a compressor in order to chill the product as you go ... you have to provide the cold, and that means cleaning out a space in the freezer -- and make it a permanently-cleared space 'cause you'll need it. Trust me.You'll want to wash the freezer bowl, first.- in the sink ONLY -- no dishwasher- no abrasives/no cleansers- warm water and liquid soap with a soft cloth and a good rinse- dry thoroughlyOnce washed, wrap the bowl in plastic. This keeps that \"freezer taste\" from getting into your frozen product-to-be. Use that handy bag that came with the unit, or use a plastic grocery bag to enclose the bowl. Place it in the freezer and close the door. For extra-fast chilling, put a bag of frozen vegetables inside the bowl.My bowl freezes in my refrigerator freezer in 8 hours. It should be a solid freeze. No sloshing, or your ice cream won't \"ice\". I hear tell it can take much longer for some folks' bowls to freeze, but check your freezer setting ... it should be, according to Cuisinart, at 0?, but mine is at 25? and works quickly.Once your bowl is solidly frozen, make your ice cream base. There are a few recipes for ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt in the recipe book included with the Ice-20, or use one of your own, but be sure it is for 1-1/2 quarts or less.We make only full-fat, fully-flavored ice creams which I can recommend, but we do not partake of sorbets or frozen yogurt, yet I can't imagine the experience would differ. The methods remain similar, and if you have frozen the bowl you're more than half way there.Come Along with Me ... the Best Is Yet To BeFrom start to finish the Cuisinart Ice-20 is easy to use, easy to clean and a dream machine for those of us who enjoy a good bowl of ice cream often ... on occasion.Once you've frozen your bowl -- which you'll want to leave in the freezer until the last minute, simply follow your chosen recipe, remembering to leave any additives such as chocolate chips or chopped nuts out until the last 5 or 10 minutes of processing. No \"extra\" should be larger than a chocolate chip -- I'm guessing this is to protect the plastic churn.Once you have your concoction ready, retrieve your freezer bowl, place it on the motor housing, place the plastic churn inside the bowl and slip the dome lid over all, making sure to align the embossed dot with the marking on the front of the motor housing to \"lock\" it (not a fool-proof mechanism, as this opens easily with less than a twist). It's really that quick.Plug in the machine and press \"on\". The motor will rotate the freezer bowl and the dome lid will hold the churn in place. Pretty simple!Carefully pour in your ice cream base and leave the room for 20 minutes or so. I dare you to try.You won't be able to do it because you won't believe you're making ice cream right there in your own kitchen. And, you'll want to appoint yourself \"Chief Taste-Tester\", as you won't want any family, friends or acquaintances to suffer at all. How big of you. You're selfless, just as I am!The dome lid offers an opening in the center through which to add ingredients, and I use it to \"sample\". Just be careful you don't lose a spoon in there. That'll cause a few raised eyebrows and strange looks when you go to serve your decadent dessert.If, after 20 or 30 minutes your ice cream isn't as thick as you'd like it (it comes out soft-serve for me), press \"off\", remove the dome lid and clean off the churn with a spatula. Just pop the bowl back in the freezer, covered, for about an hour or less, depending. The ice cream will harden nicely in about this amount of time.This is license to continue tasting at intervals, of course.You may wish to transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container for longer term storage, if you expect the ice cream to last that long. That way, you can clean the bowl and return it to the freezer to be ready for another batch.Everyone Will Scream for Ice Cream!Are there any down-sides to this appliance? None that I've found yet. For the ease with which I can use this I can't complain about having to freeze the bowl, nor is it intolerable that soft-serve is my result. I LOVE soft-serve! Plus, the ice cream can be transformed rather quickly into something firmer.The machine doesn't turn off itself, which isn't a negative for me. I can keep it running as little or as long as I like, but 25 minutes has been the longest running time in my experience. After that, we're eating ice cream!As for noise, it's tolerable. I find the Ice-20 to be much quieter than a blender, and only slightly noisier than most dishwashers. I find it comforting to hear it humming along with it's little whirring sound, for that, my friends, is the sound of ice cream in the making.Added BenefitsUsing the Cuisinart Ice-20 affords you some portion control, as you can make smaller batches than 1-1/2 quarts. If you need more than that amount it's simple to prepare batches ahead of schedule and freeze them. It's also possible to order an extra freezer bowl, which I did. It's handy and I've already made use of the extra one several times.This machine offers cord storage underneath it, allowing for only as much cord as needed to reach an outlet. The cord is about 2-1/2 feet long which is plenty for counter top use. When finished, just wind the cord up completely and store the machine for later.Since the Ice-20 is about the size of a 2-1/2 quart slow cooker it isn't difficult to store. Mine lives on a shelf inside my basement door. It would fit inside a cupboard, too, if I had a place there. You could also keep it on the counter top ...And, again, it couldn't be easier to clean. All the components, aside from the freezer bowl, need only a wipe-down with a damp cloth. The freezer bowl in anodized aluminum on the inside and plastic on the outside, so warm water and dish soap do the trick easily.You Made This?

I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes. It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream'. With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it. The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours. Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on. In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing. The device is so easy to use and clean we've been using it every day! This is one of the greatest items I have purchased in a long time and I only regret that I waited so long to get one. Here's my recipe I developed:In a pot add:9 tablespoons of powdered Vances Darifree (or any powdered milk)3 tablespoons of tapioca starch flour6 tablespoons of sugar3 cups of waterTurn heat on medium and whisk constantly to combine the dry mix with water and to prevent sticking to the pot. The mix will begin to thicken after a few minutes.Now add:1/3 cup of any butter, margarine of choice+1 or 2 teaspoons of Vanilla or other extractContinue heating and whisking until the mixture is completely combined and thickened. I do this until it begins a low boil - bubbles and steam begin.Cool in fridge and follow ice cream maker instructions.* If you want to use soy milk, rice milk or other milk simply eliminate the powdered Vances and water and replace with any 3 cups liquid substitute.* If you want to make Carob or Chocolate ice cream add 1/4 cup powdered cocoa or roasted carob to the dry mix.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Makes perfect ice cream - even non-dairy!", "unixReviewTime": 1182470400, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2007"},

It's easier to use than any other ice cream maker I've ever owned.  However, there are a couple of things to remember or you're going to be very frustrated by the experience.  First off, the freezer bowl has to be frozen solid.  Near solid isn't good enough.  I suggest you leave the bowl in your freezer for two days just to make sure it's cold enough.  Be sure your ingredients are very cold, too.  I use condensed and/or evaporated milk in a couple of my recipes and a day or two in the refrigerator is really important.  Room temperature just won't cut it.  And the thicker the better with this machine.  A custard base is an excellent way to start.Next, don't dawdle.  Get your ingredients right into the bowl.  It begins to thaw pretty quickly, especially in hot weather.  And that's when ice cream is best, isn't it?  And finally, twenty-five minutes to half an hour is about as long as the freezer bowl lasts, so if you've gone that long and it's still looking like soft-serve, get it right into a container and toss it in the freezer for a while before serving.I know it sounds complicated, but it's not really.  Most of it is just remembering to get things to the right temperature.  This isn't a big, fancy freezing unit, it's a relatively inexpensive way to make your own ice cream at home.  You're going to have to make some adjustments.  That said, I have to tell you that it's a great deal of fun to watch the ice cream freezing and to turn it out into bowls and see the eyes of your family light up when you say, &quot;The ice cream is ready!&quot;I put this item in the fun to have but not a necessity category.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Recommended with a reservation or two", "unixReviewTime": 997747200, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2001"},

The machine also works equally well for sherberts and frozen drinks.  It's extremely easy to use and cleans very easily.Few notes for better results:1) The bowl must be *frozen*. I recommend at least 2 days in the freezer between uses (you may want a second bowl).2) Upon removing the bowl from the freezer, add ingredients and use -- it will start to thaw immediately.  A friend noted that covering the top of the unit while mixing causes it to retain its &quot;cool&quot; longer (a plate over the opening works well).3) The ingredients must be very cold.  If cooking ingredients (such as for fruit or egg enhanced recipes), it's absolutely necessary to chill the resulting mixture before adding it to the unit.4) Choice in ingredients can make or break your ice cream.  While milk can be used, cream results in a much richer, thicker, tastier ice cream.  Also, make sure you've crushed or finely chopped any solid ingredients before adding, as otherwise, they will clog in the mechanism; they should also be added during the last 5 minutes only or will impede freezing (same goes for alcohol).  Thorough mixing of ingredients is important, as well, since the machine does not churn the mixture (sugar especially needs to be well dissolved or will result in uneven flavoring).5) Regardless of what you do, you will produce very soft ice cream.  Pouring the result into a freezer-proof container and freezing for a few hours to one day works very well.I know that sounds like a lot of hassles, but it's really not.The preparation of ingredients can range from moments to hours, as your options are quite limitless.It makes 1.5 quarts of ice cream, which is not a limitation (should you feel you will consistently need more servings, invest in additional bowls). It stores very well, lasting for a couple of weeks without crystalizing.  I would use mine every day if I could remember to buy cream!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My guilty pleasure...", "unixReviewTime": 1003017600, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2001"},

To re-attach the T-bar to the protractor insert the threaded shaft on the thumb screws in the large holes on the protractor, thread the nuts on enough to secure them, the slide the nuts into the T-bar channel and tighten down the thumb screw.

Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the \"low\" settings, but when you set it on \"high,\" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm.

Newhouse", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewText": "I was looking for a fan that would really draw fresh air into my apartment (5 rooms, total ~1000sq ft).  It's very frustrating to me when it's nice and cool outside on a summer evening, but still sticky and stuffy inside from the heat of the day.  I've tried two of the little twin window fans, a larger oscillating fan on a stand, and small round fans in windows, but even all these of those in combination never really seemed to make a big difference in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been in houses with attic-mounted whole-house fans, and it's amazing how quickly they'll exchange the air in a whole house!  That's the effect I was hoping for.In short, this Lasko 2155a has met my expectations.  If I turn it on high exhaust, open a couple windows on the opposite end of the apartment, and close the rest, it does a great job of pulling in fresh (cool!) air.  Of course it's not as fast or as powerful as a real attic whole-house fan, but especially given the price, convenience, and simple installation, it's a pretty good substitute.  It shouldn't even be in the same category as the little twin window fans - those are good for a single room, but they don't hold a candle to this Lasko.  When this is running on high exhaust, and with only a few other windows open, there's a noticeable breeze coming in those windows.  I notice a distinct change in the coolness and \"freshness\" of the inside air after only a few minutes.  It is pretty loud when it's on high, but it's not the obtrusive roar that I've seen described in other reviews.  I wouldn't want to sit right next to it and have a conversation or listen to music, but if you're in the next room, it's really not distractingly loud.  Also, I find it's helpful to leave this on high for a few (10-15?) minutes, and then turning it to low does a fine job of maintaining the fresh air inside.  When it's on low, the noise isn't bad at all - it's quieter than the oscillating stand fan I'd use otherwise.  Not distracting or bothersome, even if you're in the same room.So if you live in a small house or apartment, and you're looking for a reasonably-priced alternative to a full attic fan, I highly recommend this one!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great fan!

There is a BIG difference between low/medium/high settings, which enables you to customize air flow to your liking.  Since the knob is manually operated, there are no complex, computerized electronics to malfunction.

(Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2. Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).  You can remove 6 screws from inside the house which allows you access to clean the blades and the outside grill.Remember this fan is all plastic construction, fairly sturdy, but be careful not to strip screws by tightening too much.Finally, we've found that we are able to get a lot further into the summer season before we close up the house and turn on the central air because of this fan.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Essential For Smokers", "unixReviewTime": 1360713600, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2013"},

The fan is light enough and motor is smooth so it is unlikely it will vibrate itself out of the grooves unless I'm really careless about tightening the screws.I'm pleased this isn't a permanent solution (I didn't drill any holes in the trim).

I have kept 2 to 3 running at any given time between the months of March and November whenever possible/necessary.  This fan is one of 3 that work without flaws. We've tried to repair the others, cleaned them every year, to no avail.  Once the motor fails, that's it.  In fact, one of the first one's threw a fan blade which was quite loud.To deal with simple vibration, we devised a system involving thin strips of wood for the bottoms and 2x6s on the sides to provide a solid, semi-permanent gap fillers.  I painted the wood to match the room paint and it seems to work well.  Our windows are of the cheap variety (drywall with alum. windows wedged into place, no frames).I might have sprung for the next size up, but I couldn't afford the 100 bucks, not to mention, the motors wouldn't match up with the one's I'd purchased so far, IMO.  I just waited until amazon.com was selling this and pounced on it (due to the low price). I'm happy with these and will probably continue to purchase these if they are still made.  These fans really move the air in our house and I firmly believe they do work better when at least two are involved (one in, one on out or sometimes both on out with other windows in the house open) I'm lucky to have double doors in the \"two fans room\" that open up to allow a wide birth for the air to flow through.Small footnote: I did try ordering one from another good online store, but when that one arrived, the control knob fell off in shipment and wouldn't stay on.  Seemed cheaply made.  The one from amazon.com that arrive recently is intact and running smoothly, oddly with no vibration.UPDATE comment: as of 8/13/11 another of our fan's motors is acting up and I may have a theory about that.  Please comment to this review if you think this could be it.  I use non-aerosol hairspray (on my hair) in the room where the fan is.  Only fans that drew the air from the room were affected.  Just in the last two years we turned the fan direction to BOTH fans OUT in the room with two windows and the rest of the house windows open.  The hairspray presumably will end up being drawn up by the fans, especially the one I am standing 10 feet away from and right in line with.  In prior years, that fan was set up to allow air in, not out, for room re-circulation.  So in that case it was blowing the spray away from the fan.  However the other fan, further to the side in the second window (blowing out) was always the fan that developed motor problems; it would just bind up.  Opinions?

Purchasing this pivoting fan made all the difference! This fan immediately help drop the temperature upstairs by about 2-3 degrees.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.I LIKE:------1. The best feature of this fan is the pivoting ability of the fan. The fan pivoted and held its position straight out of the box, I did not need to adjust or tighten anything. Photo #1 shows the fan pivoting, Photo #4 and photo#5 show two views of the fan at the bottom of my stairs.2. Photo #3 shows the fan on the digital scale. The fan is fairly light just under 7 pounds and 2 oz.3. I like handle on the top of the fan. It makes it very easy and comfortable to carry it around.4. The fan is fairly quiet even on the high setting. It producing no rattle noises of any sort, the sound you hear is white-noise type sound of blades pushing the air. It is so quiet that on a number of hot nights I took that fan into the bedroom. I am a light sleeper yet the noise from this fan did not bother me even as I was trying to fall asleep.I DON'T LIKE:-------------1. Minor: the switch to turn on the fan in the center back of the fan. So when you pivot it up you need to reach under the fan to turn it on or off. Close-up of the switch is shown on Photo #2.2. Minor: the length of the cord is 6.5 feet. I wish it was longer. I have to use the fan with an extension cord.Lasko 3300 fan is sold under several slightly different names but with the same model number and description. From April 2012 to September 2012 the price of this item (when sold directly from Amazon with free shipping) varied between $30 and $34.

I use a handy tool that helps my price comparison shopping on Amazon, if you search in google for Amazon price alert the one I use has 'camel' in its name.  It shows you the history and also can send you an email when your desired price is reached.Overall, I am very pleased with this fan and it quickly became my favorite fan of the 4-5 fans we have in the house: it pivots for great air flow control, it is powerful to quickly cool a room, and it is quiet to do its job without being noticed.Ali Julia review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful and quiet!

I love this fan. My apt gets super hot in the summer and without central air, it can be tough during the days. The AC we have isn't quite strong enough to really cool down the place below 77 degrees or so. This fan has made the summer so much more bearable. Moving air in the apt makes a huge difference. This fan produces a strong breeze/current. It usually stays on the low setting, as that is more than enough to provide adequate current in the room.The fan is pretty quiet. There's 3 speed settings, and of course if you have it on high, it can get a little loud. But it's not nearly as loud as other fans I've owned, so I was pleased with that. It barely weighs anything, so moving it from one room to the next, if necessary, is easy. It has a nice handle on top for easy transport. The fan can also be tilted easily so you can direct the air wherever you'd like. If you don't want the air blowing right on you, you can tilt it so it blows towards the ceiling. If you want it pointed at you, pivot it to the necessary angle.My only issue with the fan is the ability to clean it. It doesn't have any easy way to disassemble it, at least that I can see. I'm not motivated enough to REALLY take it apart, so I wish there was an easier way to pop it open and give the blades a nice wipe down. Because it sits on the floor, it often sucks up my girlfriend's lose hairs and the catch on the grill.

I always forgot to take it off before opening the lid, and one time it fell down hard on the floor, almost hitting my toes.  Turns out there's a purpose.  It's a visual/audio indicator of how much steam is coming out.  If it rocks too fast then I'd need to lower the fire.  On a pressure cooker, more heat doesn't cook any faster.  It only wastes gas/electricity and drains out the liquid inside faster.Although the manual recommends waiting for the steam to go away by itself before opening the lid, or dunk the whole thing into cold water, which could be a few minutes.  I usually take a very long spatula, position my hand below the lid and gently pry the rocker cap off to let the steam out faster.  If you do this, be very careful or else you'd get burn.  Seriously, this is hotter than normal steam.It works very well.  Holds pressure much better than my old Mantra pressure cooker, and thus tenderizes the meat much faster.At first I was hesitant to buy stainless steel, because it's more expensive and doesn't conduct heat well.  But the bottom has a layer of other metal to absorb heat, so it's not any different compared to my aluminum Mantra cooker.  Stainless is easier to clean as well, and looks better.

Boy could I not have been more wrong. I started thinking of getting one probably for the same reasons you are, the appeal of fast cooking, with tasty and healthy results, and improved safety over the pressure cookers from the past. My wife and I have had this model now for a couple of weeks and it delivers on all counts.The basic idea is that because of the pressure that builds up inside, water gets to 250 degrees, it is super hot. And at that temperature it can break down the tough parts of meats and cook things very quickly. Yet it also retains nutrients and tastes good. Well it does cook fast and it is tasty. I will take the experts opinion that it is also a healthy way to cook.As a PC newbee I had no idea what to expect. First off is a little bit of assembly. That went quickly and smoothly. Second is READING the instruction booklet. This is not a pan or a microwave or something like that. It is safe..but also something that is, well, under pressure. And pressure can be dangerous. After getting familiar with the parts of the pressure cooker we cooked our first meal, a pot roast. It was super easy and delicious. We used, frankly, a pretty cheap piece of meat but it came out tasting fantastic. It was quick but something to keep in mind is cooking time does not usually include the time to heat it up and the time to cool it down. Also you can't just walk away. Once the pressure seals the cooker most of the time you have to then reduce the heat. But it really isn't that much oversight.In any event even taking all of that into account it was still by far the fastest pot roast I have ever cooked and better than average in taste. We have done some chicken dishes and some rice dishes. It has turned out perfect rice in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise. We are still getting a feel for seasoning. Sometimes we have had dishes too seasoned and other times not but nothing that hasn't been easily as tasty as other ways we cook things.So if you are a PC newbee like me I say give it a try. As long as you read the instructions and respect the pressure it is a pretty easy way to cook with excellent tasty results in a quick amount of time. Granted it has only been a couple of weeks but we have eaten out much less these 2 weeks. We picked up a well regarded cookbook on AmazonPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand so far so good. This could easily become the main way you cook, it has that a good a combination of benefits and realtive ease of use. What it excels at is...great results/unit of effort and time.

I was looking for a replacement for some weirdo one my hubby's ex left him years ago. I have a giant-sized Presto pressure canner and love it. So I like Presto and liked the size of the ex's weirdo canner. (weird because it had handles that came off all the time, no instructions, no visible brand I could find and was a strange operator.)I wanted stainless steel--easier in the long run, to clean and to cook in. Six quarts is just about the perfect size since I rarely cook for a crowd anymore.This is a nice, solid, reliable cooker. Presto does a good job on the owners manual, some basic recipes, etc. The cooker has a little rack so you can keep your meat off the floor of the cooker.This is not a canner. You could (and I have) use it as a little baby canner for a small load of small jars. I have used it as a canner for about 4-5 pints. The instructions do not say this is a canner, and you probably should know what you're doing if you plan to can with this. It takes about the same amount of time whether you can in this or in the giant cooker, so why not do a large load, I say.Pressure cooking doesn't necessarily save time depending on what you're cooking, when you consider it takes a while to build the pressure. This takes some practice, and knowing your food and your stove. I like it because it cooks meat really tender quicker than any other method.It takes very little experience to get to know the proper pressure without a guage. It makes a rythmic rocking noise, not too fast,not too slow.I find clean up a breeze. This baby is dishwasher safe. I soak it a couple minutes, if needed, then pop her in the DW.

It takes really tough meat and make is buttery soft.  I haven't tried cooking veggies on these things, just because they are more delicate than a piece of shank.  By the way, I just ordered two for gifts.  And it made from stainless steal.One word of caution though!!!...  When cooking with this, make sure after you hear it whistle, turn down your heat to a low medium to a medium!!!..  All you want is a soft whistle.  It's compared to having a roll boil and a boiling water; it's just a waste of energy. Violent whistling means, too much pressure is building up, not good coz, the food can only take a certain pressure to still be recognizable, and the pot can only take so much pressure.  I've heard form a couple of users who neglected this \"alarm\", actually had their \"tops\" blow up.  A couple of users also reported, they actually got burned by the steam.  Also, if you have to move the pot while is hot and still whistling, do it carefully, make sure it level and place it down carefully or the pressure might burst the top off.  But, don't let this scare you!!!  Like any other tools, you have to know how to use them properly.  A knife should be used with care.  A pressure cooker!!!  A LOT of care and common sense.Tips and advice:  When cooking stews and other stuff, make sure you dont' have too much liquid or meat/veggies when cooking or you might end up with burnt food or worst, a stew geyser.  If you need to add more stuff to the pot while it is still hot and whistling; care fully place the hot pot under running cold water and cold bath and wait for the pressure to decipate.

I think it gives me problems if the black rubber gasket inside the lid is not positioned correctly, then it is impossible to get the lid on, probably because the cooker is new to me and needs to be &#34;broken in&#34; a little, especially the lid gasket.

I really appreciate cooking brown rice in only twelve minutes and pre-soaked beans in less than that. One thing that should be understood is the safety mechanism which prevents steam from building up pressure unless the cover is closed completely as it should be. There is a cylindrical metal plug in a hole in the handle which gets pushed up by steam pressure (not talking about the central steam vent pipe capped by a heavy wobbling rocker). If the lid is not closed properly, an ingeniously designed sliding flange in the handle prevents the cylindrical plug from rising up to close the hole completely, therefore allowing steam to continuously vent out of the unsealed hole. This prevents a dangerous explosion of a loose lid. The first time I used the cooker, I did not realize that a bowl which I had placed inside to contain the rice was preventing the sliding flange from allowing the cylindrical plug to rise. When I finally realized how the flange was supposed to work, I moved the interior bowl away from the locking mechanism (after everything had cooled down, of course) and then everything worked fine. If you feel some resistance in closing the lid, don't force anything. Make sure the sliding flange is not preventing the cylindrical plug from rising. Once you see this, you will understand it without so many words.I especially enjoy the cheerful action of the central rocker (pressure regulator) when pressure builds up and steam begins to sputter out of the central vent pipe. The heavy rocker wobbles merrily reminding me of an old fashioned steam locomotive chugging along. This action informs me how much I can turn the heat down to keep on cooking without wasting water or energy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cooks wonderfully fast and with a cheerful attitude", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"},

On top of that, both my mother and my mother-in-law warned me that cheap pressure cookers are dangerous, and I *must* buy something more expensive for safety reasons. I am just very glad that they were both wrong!This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made on amazon. I still cannot believe they sell this for $35! The pot does not feel cheap at all. It has very sturdy handles, and a thick, heavy bottom, which holds in heat well.  I like this pan so much that sometimes I use it instead of my skillet to sautee meat, because of the deeper pot + the cover, less cleaning up for me :-)I love making soup and stock, but it usually takes up so much of my time when the stock is simmering.  With this pressure cooker, I can make a meat-fall-off-the-bone soup in an hour!Some might find this pot to be a little on the small side, but this pot works great for my wife and I. Although we have guests over regularly, I find the capacity of the pot to be very good. I would guess that this pot would work well for up to a 4-person family.Pros:=====- Cheap, at $35, it's hard to beat- Sturdy, I was afraid that the plastic handles would break easily, but they are in fact quite strong- Stainless steel makes it great for browning meat pieces for stew or stock, and it heats up fast and holds heat well.- Safe, you cannot open it when it's pressurized.- Dish washer safe, though I prefer to wash it by hand.Cons:=====- The handle can be tricky to hold with one hand. My hands are small, and when you've closed the top, the handle is kind of big. Luckily, I don't need to do this very often, and when I need to move it around, I just use both handles.- The top cap can be tricky to clean. I usually soak it in hot soapy water, and then clean it thoroughly with Q-tip.Watch outs:===========- The handle curves in a way that it catches any dripping liquid, I've hurt myself once when I wasn't careful at opening the cover.- Do *NOT* remove the cap while it's blowing! The steam from inside is extremely hot and as soon as you remove the cap, the hot steam will shoot up faster than you can move your hand(s) away.Tips:=====- I keep some water bottles in my freezer, and when I need to cool this off in a hurry, I can make a bath of cold water in my sink, put the hot pot inside, and throw the froze water bottles in. This usually cools it down very fast, great when I want to refrigerate it overnight to skim off the fat, and didn't want to wait too long for it to cool down.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great value, sturdy cooker", "unixReviewTime": 1147478400, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2006"},

My mother instilled so much fear in me about using a pressure cooker that I didn't even want to try it until a friend finally convinced me.  Now I'd absolutely hate to be without this fast and safe way to cook.My first experiment was a recipe for Chicken Cacciatore.  Three pounds of chicken cooked for 10 minutes (at 6000' altitude) and was fork-tender and delicious.  My next endeavor was a ham and bean soup, which cooked for 35 minutes without having to presoak the beans, and it turned out perfectly. Beans were completely cooked but not mushy.  Next came a pot roast with potatoes, which cooked for 45 minutes starting partially frozen, and was perfect.  Then tried a chicken with plum sauce--again a nine-minute success.  Most recently we tried pasta with meat sauce, which was a delicious one-pot meal ready in 7 minutes cooking time.I love this Presto model cooker, because it has all the safety features, but still allows careful monitoring of the\"jiggle top\", and allows me to judge how fast the dish is cooking. This is a heavy and well-built unit. The safety precautions are easy, and are fully described in the accompanying manual.I also recommmend Lorna Sass' book \"Pressure Perfect\", for beginners.

I also have the 8-quart stainless steel model by Presto and I don't like that one as much as this one. I like the little rocker on top better because I know exactly how much pressure it has. It is super easy to carry this extremely lightweight pressure cooker to the sink, run water over it, and in 5-10 seconds the pressure is down! It is not heavy or hot. You just have to be careful when you do this. I actually prefer this method of quick cooling to the method used in the 8-quart, which is to open the little weight and let the steam shoot out the top. That method takes about a minute, plus there's steam all over the place. That seems more dangerous to me than going to the sink.This model is a smaller version of the 6-quart, so if you think this one is too small, that one would work for a family. This size is just right for one or two people. I always make very small quantities of food in it anyway as I don't like to have a lot of leftovers.Cleanup with this product is very fast and easy as it is so lightweight.

While it requires a bit of assembly (handles and valve) these are minor issues.  Very well made cooker and the 64 page booklet included useful information and recipes.  Bought the 4 quart model since use for one person most of the time.  Not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely.  Like the fact that Presto has replacement seals when needed.  Obviously cooker is useless if do not have this seal and in time am sure will require replacement.  Buying one for my daughter as well who is busy career woman and wants to eat healthy and quickly.  Keeping nutrients and vitamins in the food a plus as is the savings in time cooking a good meal.  Easy to recommend this item.The instruction book that comes with this cooker is probably one of the best I have read in recent years.  At the same time it is also very detailed in the care, maintenance and handling of the cooker.  For example, it recommends replacing the seal and the safety plug once every two years.  Of course that probably depends on the amount of use and the care you take of the product.  In any case recommends replacing the safety plug when you replace the seal.  Both are available on Amazon but this will mean a continuing cost to use the product. At the moment using Amazon Prime cost is about $15 for the pair of items or roughly $7.50 a year if replace every two years. I do highly recommend anyone wanting to use the product to read the instructions very carefully and perhaps highlight the key items.  For example what foods to cook and more important what foods not to cook.  What level in the pot to use for various items depending on their expansion during cooking.  Also you need to look through the hole for the safety plug to be sure it is clear and use pipe cleaners to clean that hole and also the hole through the nut, all explained very clearly in the instructions.  Various tips on how to clean (and how not to clean) the pot are very useful.  If you have induction stove you will need the stainless steel pot since the aluminum pots are not magnetic, but then you probably knew that.Today with so many instructions written in China often they are difficult to read or not very worthwhile.  The instructions with this cooker are quite different. They are important to use the product safely and to get the most value out of the product.  If you are someone who seldom reads instructions or is not willing to spend an hour or so learning about this cooking method or who will not take the time to follow the safety instructions then you probably should consider a different method of cooking.  But an hour or so spent learning about he product will pay off in better cooking, shorter time spent cooking and more healthy eating. I ordered a second cooker for my busy career oriented daughter but then cancelled the order after reading the instructions as I am not sure as busy as she is that she would read and follow them.  I plan to show her mine and see if she will spend the time to learn the system.  If so will order again for her.  Or give her mine and buy second for myself. To me it is worth spending the time to learn about safely using this product but I can see that it is not for everyone.  It is not a pot you just pour water into, stick lid on and fire up the burners.  But once you learn how to take care of it and use it I think you will be extremely pleased with the cooking experience. And the time spent learning and caring for the cooker will pay off in shorter and better cooking.

My only criticism is that, unlike my 8 qt., this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve, so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the \"jiggler\" steam valve is reminiscent of much older models, Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!

Gebhardt", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I've owned and used a 4 quart pressure cooker for 38 years and have been delighted that parts are still easy to get for it.  So when I decided that I needed increased cooking capacity, I was happy to see that the current models are similar to the one that I bought in 1974.The cooker is pretty much what you need to cook with little more, no basket you might find convenient for jars used for canning.  Other models specifically for canning have this.  It is, however, well designed for cooking and the design well executed.  The handles (there are three) are not attached but are easily assembled using 5 phillips screws.  I used some heat resistant anti-seize compound sparingly on the threads.  The same as I use on the spark plugs in my car.  The handles on my old 4 quart cooker are slightly loose but the screws are hopelessly seized, despite being made from stainless steel.The handle and helper handle on the opposing side is just right for managing it on the range.  The low aluminum rack, called a trivet, has not changed at all, it allows the food to sit above the water in the bottom and prevents it from burning. The pressure regulator has changed little and the over-pressure emergency relief plug is the same, except that the poppet valve is now incorporated with the lid pressure interlock.  The poppet valve allows steam to escape until the rate is high enough to close the valve and seal the cooker allowing the pressure to begin building.  The lid interlock prevents the lid from being opened when the pot is pressurized.  This strikes me as a redundant feature since it is almost impossible to open the lid when even it is under even a small amount of pressure, but I guess someone has done it.  Consequently, with the safety interlock, closing the lid must be done with a little more care than on my old cooker which did not have it.  It just takes a little more attention to alignment.  The lid sealing ring is thinner, but is actually easier to grease and install in the lid.  Finally, the gauge of the stainless steal is exactly as thick as my older 4 quart cooker although it appears thinner.  The sides, lid, and bottom of the older models are uniform thickness and are heavy enough to spread heat evenly.  This cooker now has a layer of aluminum to help spread the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot.  This layer is clad in stainless steel, so all exposed surfaces, most importantly, the bottom, are stainless steel.  The pot and lid are highly polished, but the bar code sticker was a little difficult to get off the side.  There are indented markings at the levels of 1/2 and 2/3 capacity which are visible on the inside and outside of the pot, a nice addition.The inside dimensions are 8 1/2 inches in diameter and 6 1/4 inches deep same diameter as my 4 quart and about 2 1/4 inches deeper.I cooked a 15 lbs pumpkin using it an my old 4 quart in parallel (cooking several pots in each cooker) and I'm with happy with the results.  Despite the extra complication of the lid interlock it proved easy to operate and the thinner seal seems less likely to leak as sometime happens with the older cooker.While I was a little put off by the lighter-looking gauge metal (actually the same thicknes) and leery of the complication of the lid-interlock, after using it I was very pleased to see that Presto is still maintaining excellence in design and construction of a classic cooking utensil whose basic utility is often overlooked in today's gadget filled kitchen.

I have used both natural pressure release and the method to speed it up by sticking the cooker in the sink and running cold water from the faucet over it (it takes all of 20 seconds and doesn't have to be so complicated as making an ice bath for it in the sink). I have never seen any signs of the metal layers splitting, the pot warping, and there has been no denting from handling and washing. The 6-quart capacity is enough for me and my husband to have soup with some left over for lunch or another soup dinner, but not so much that we're sick of eating the same thing.If you are trying to decide whether to get a pressure cooker in general, I would encourage you to go for it. Most weeknights, I am too impatient to wait for time-intensive things like tomato sauce, stew meat, root veggies cut into chunks, lentils, risotto, or even just tender cabbage. Pressure cookers prepare these things quickly and make them taste like they've been cooking forever. Most of the pressure cooker recipes I use take 30-40 minutes total for prep and cook (I usually make soup in this cooker), so it's become a life saver when I come home from work late.If you already know you want a pressure cooker but are trying to decide what type to get, I would say that I don't mind the simplicity of this cooker. Normally the justification to get a product that is the \"latest and greatest\" is that you are certain it will get a lot of use so you might as well spend the extra money for extra features that possibly save you time.

Replacemenat parts are easy to buy. You can't open it if it's under pressure because it has a lock by the handle (safety feature).

This is stainless steel which is good because you don't want aluminum (aluminum will stain and get eaten away with acidic food such as vinegar or lemon juice...).Another thing to consider is that it takes time to heat up and cool down so even though all pressure cookers say it takes a lot less time to cook, they don't take the heat-up cool-down time into consideration, even though they are correct about the actual cooking time.Good pressure cooker.EDITIn 2007, I bought a Kuhn-Rikon pressure cooker and I'm even more pleased with that.It's quite a bit more expensive  (4-7 times?) but a *lot* quieter as it relies on an internal spring to maintain pressure as opposed to gravity for the Presto. The Kuhn-Rikon also allows less water to escape. I keep both of them but I haven't used the presto for 4 months now. Considering I bought the Presto in 1999, it's amazing that it works perfectly even though it got heavy use. I even put the rubber seal and the lid in the dishwasher every time and it still held up.

But, anyways I am. Some of the most common problems that people face with pressure cookers are: loud sound, too many whistles and food that sticks to the bottom never comes off while cleaning. This cooker is a pleasant surprise, because none of these problems happen with this Presto. I simply dumped lentils, carrots, peas and pearl onions altogether into this cooker and boom, after 30 minutes, the lentils soup was ready. Now, you may think what is so special about this. Well, here is the interesting part. Generally, when lentils are cooked in pressure cookers, they appear like separate lentil seeds cooked individually and do not gel with the vegetables together to form into a running soup. But, after cooking in this Presto cooker, the whole thing turned out to be a perfect soup, even without me putting any extra effort to mix the vegetables with a spatula. It blended the lentils and vegetables in such a beautiful way that it was just ready to eat. Now, here is the good part, it did not make annoying whistles, it did not pour even a single drop of water or soup out of the top and the inner side of the lid is immaculate even after cooking three cups of lentils. So, that means, nothing was spilling during the cooking process. It is the most controlled and well-designed cooker I have ever used in my whole life. Trust me you will not be disappointed.

This was perfect!It clamps down well, is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise, its a small, durable storage box.

Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now, you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.

Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split, so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes, the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.
